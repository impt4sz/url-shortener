## My process

- I started with the main functionality, which was fetching the data, and then moved on to building the UI.
- The building process for the UI was easy but also quite time-consuming, as this project had a whole page with different sections, such as CTA, Footer, Hero, etc. Overall, the process for this project was quite simple and easy, as there was nothing specifically unique about it. It was just another API project.
- Thank you.
